Final Enhanced Summary of App Structure and Workflow:

1. Application Entry & Core Setup (MainActivity.kt, MyApplication.kt):
    * Single-Activity Architecture (MainActivity).
    * Hilt: @HiltAndroidApp on MyApplication initializes DI. @AndroidEntryPoint on MainActivity.
    * UI: 100% Jetpack Compose with WorkTrackerTheme.
    * Navigation: Jetpack Navigation with NavController and AppNavigationHost. Routes defined in AppRoutes.

2. Dependency Injection (Dagger-Hilt - DatabaseModule.kt, AppModule.kt):
    * DatabaseModule.kt (@SingletonComponent):
        * Provides AppDatabase ("work_tracker_db", includes MIGRATION_2_3).
        * Provides WorkActivityDao (from AppDatabase).
        * Provides WorkActivityRepository (implemented by WorkActivityRepositoryImpl, injected with WorkActivityDao). All are singletons.
    * AppModule.kt (@SingletonComponent):
        * Provides GeminiProService as a singleton.
    * Injection: ViewModels use @HiltViewModel and @Inject constructor. Repositories and other services use @Inject constructor and are provided by modules.

3. Data Layer:
    * Room Database (AppDatabase.kt, WorkActivityLog.kt, WorkActivityDao.kt):
        * WorkActivityLog: Entity with auto-generating id, categoryName, startTime, endTime, description, operatorId, expenses, logDate, taskSuccessful, assignedBy.
        * WorkActivityDao: Standard CRUD operations, plus getOngoingActivityByCategoryName, getOngoingActivities, and wipeDatabaseAndResetIds (transactional method to clear logs and reset auto-increment sequence).
        * AppDatabase: Version 3, handles migration from 2 to 3.
    * Repository (WorkActivityRepository.kt, WorkActivityRepositoryImpl.kt):
        * Abstracts Room DAO. Exposes suspend functions and Flows for data access.

4. MVVM Architecture & Screen Breakdown:
    * Main Screen (MainActivity.kt -> MainScreen Composable):
        * ViewModel: MainViewModel.
        * UI: ActionCards for navigation ("Log Work Activity", "View work activities", placeholders). TopAppBar with "Wipe Database" (password protected).
        * State: MainScreenUiState (handles password dialog visibility, input, errors).
        * Events: MainScreenEvent (DB wipe success/failure).
    * Log Work Activity Category Selection (LogWorkActivityScreen.kt):
        * ViewModel: LogWorkViewModel.
        * UI: Lists categories from activity_categories.txt (with fallback). Highlights ongoing activities. Navigates to WorkDetailsRoute on selection.
        * State: LogWorkUiState (list of CategoryDisplayInfo, loading state).
        * CategoryDisplayInfo(name: String, isOngoing: Boolean).
        * File Dependency: LogWorkViewModel directly reads C:/Users/asus/AndroidStudioProjects/WorkTracker/activity_categories.txt. This is a point of fragility for deployment.
    * Work Details Screen (WorkDetailsRoute.kt -> WorkDetailsScreen.kt):
        * Setup: WorkDetailsRoute gets GenericWorkDetailsViewModel and sets up WorkDetailsCoordinator.
        * ViewModel: GenericWorkDetailsViewModel.
            * Receives categoryName via SavedStateHandle.
            * Manages WorkDetailsState.
            * Handles loading ongoing activity, starting new activities, input validation (validateInputsAndSetEndButtonState), and saving/ending activities.
            * Emits NavigationEvent.NavigateBack.
        * Coordinator (WorkDetailsCoordinator): Intermediary between ViewModel and UI.
        * UI: WorkDetailsScreen displays input fields, time information (live duration), and start/end buttons.
        * State: WorkDetailsState (comprehensive state).
        * Actions: WorkDetailsActions (data class for UI callbacks).
    * View Logs Screen (ViewLogsScreen.kt):
        * ViewModel: ViewLogsViewModel.
        * UI: TextField for Operator ID filter. LazyColumn displays logs (Sr. No., Date, Activity, Duration, Op.ID).
        * State: ViewLogsUiState (list of LogDisplayInfo, filter text, loading state).
        * LogDisplayInfo(srNo, date, activityCategory, duration, operatorId).

5. Key Features and Logic:
    * Activity Logging: Start, details, end. Ongoing activities loaded.
    * Activity Viewing: List all logs, filter by Operator ID. Sr. No. is auto-generated id.
    * Database Wipe: Clears logs, resets auto-increment ID. Password protected.
    * Live Duration: Work details screen shows live timer.
    * Input Validation: GenericWorkDetailsViewModel has robust form validation.

Suggestions for Future Development:
    * Category Management: Refactor category loading from hardcoded file path.
    * Error Handling: Standardize further.
    * Testing: Implement unit and UI tests.
    * Use Cases/Interactors: Consider for more complex logic.
    * Configuration Management: Securely manage API keys/configs.
    * Advanced Reporting: Placeholder feature.
    * Data Sync/Backup: Consider explicit cloud sync for future.
