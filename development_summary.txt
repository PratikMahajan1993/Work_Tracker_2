**Project: Work Tracker - Enhancements to Work Details Logging**

**Phase 1: Adding New Fields to Database and State**
1.  **Updated `WorkActivityLog.kt` (Room Entity):**
    *   Added new fields: `logDate` (Long, for timestamp), `taskSuccessful` (Boolean, nullable), and `assignedBy` (String, nullable).
2.  **Updated `AppDatabase.kt`:**
    *   Incremented database version from 2 to 3.
    *   Implemented `MIGRATION_2_3` to add the new columns (`logDate`, `taskSuccessful`, `assignedBy`) to the `work_activity_logs` table using `ALTER TABLE` SQL commands. The `logDate` was given a default value of the current time for existing rows.
3.  **Updated `DatabaseModule.kt`:**
    *   Ensured the new `MIGRATION_2_3` was added to the Room database builder.
4.  **Updated `WorkDetailsState.kt`:**
    *   Added corresponding fields: `logDate` (Long), `taskSuccessful` (Boolean?), and `assignedBy` (String).

**Phase 2: ViewModel Updates**
1.  **Updated `GenericWorkDetailsViewModel.kt`:**
    *   Modified `uiState` to reflect the new fields from `WorkDetailsState`.
    *   Added new public functions: `onTaskSuccessChanged(isSuccess: Boolean)` and `onAssignedByChanged(assignee: String)` to update the state.
    *   Updated `saveWorkActivityLog()` to retrieve the new fields from the `uiState` and include them when creating/saving a `WorkActivityLog` instance.
    *   Ensured `logDate` is initialized (e.g., to `System.currentTimeMillis()`) when a new log entry is effectively started or when the ViewModel is initialized for a new entry.

**Phase 3: UI Updates (`WorkDetailsScreen.kt`)**
1.  Added UI elements to display and interact with the new fields:
    *   A non-editable `Text` composable to display the `logDate` (formatted as "dd MMM yyyy").
    *   A `Row` of `RadioButton`s for "Task Successful?" (Yes/No).
    *   A `Row` of `RadioButton`s for "Assigned By" ("TOP MGT", "CEO", "SELF").
2.  Ensured these new UI elements are enabled/disabled based on `state.startTime != null`, consistent with other fields.
3.  Introduced `AssignedByOptions` object and a helper `RadioButtonWithText` composable.

**Phase 4: Connecting UI Actions and Refactoring**
1.  **Updated `WorkDetailsActions.kt`:**
    *   Added new action callbacks: `onTaskSuccessChanged: (Boolean) -> Unit` and `onAssignedByChanged: (String) -> Unit`.
2.  **Updated `WorkDetailsCoordinator.kt`:**
    *   Added new public functions (`onTaskSuccessChanged`, `onAssignedByChanged`) to delegate calls to the ViewModel.
    *   Corrected a string template issue in `Toast.makeText` to properly display `categoryName`.
3.  **Updated `WorkDetailsRoute.kt`:**
    *   Updated the instantiation of `WorkDetailsActions` to map the new UI actions to the corresponding methods in `WorkDetailsCoordinator`.
    *   Initially, `WorkDetailsActions` was temporarily moved here, then refactored to be solely in `WorkDetailsActions.kt`.

**Phase 5: Build Configuration and Troubleshooting**
1.  **Updated `gradle/libs.versions.toml`:**
    *   Added `composeVersion = "1.6.11"`.
2.  **Updated `app/build.gradle.kts`:**
    *   Resolved a deprecation warning by migrating `kotlinOptions { jvmTarget = "..." }` to the new `kotlin { compilerOptions { jvmTarget.set(...) } }` DSL.
3.  **Error Resolution & Iterative Refinement:**
    *   Addressed multiple build failures due to:
        *   Syntax errors in `WorkDetailsScreen.kt` from incorrect newline escaping during file writes.
        *   Redeclaration of the `WorkDetailsActions` data class (initially in `WorkDetailsScreen.kt` and then also in `WorkDetailsRoute.kt` before being consolidated to `WorkDetailsActions.kt`).
        *   Incorrect and incomplete definitions of `WorkDetailsActions` leading to "unresolved reference" errors.
        *   Incorrect string template escaping (`${'\'$\''}{...}` instead of `${...}`) in various Kotlin files, which caused syntax errors and runtime issues (like the Toast message).
4.  **Performed several Gradle Sync, Clean, and Build cycles** throughout the process to ensure changes were correctly integrated and to identify and fix compilation issues.

The overall goal was to extend the functionality of the work details logging screen, which involved modifications across the database, data layer, ViewModel, UI, and navigation/coordination components, along with necessary build script updates and iterative debugging.
